0:00:00.240,0:00:07.240
Ok huh I'­m from Canada, we know we'­re not
going to do it alone and I'­d encourage you

0:00:10.549,0:00:16.640
to try to get in the frame of mind to bid.
It'­s not the US only or France only or Japan

0:00:16.640,0:00:21.609
only or, well it could be China only, but
beyond that there is a lot of work to do we

0:00:21.609,0:00:25.890
should you should be helping each other.
My field is on the actual core design so I'­ll

0:00:25.890,0:00:29.220
try to give you a little bit of basics and
try to tell you where generally things are

0:00:29.220,0:00:32.410
going in the world.
Thorium is not fissile on its own, it doesn'­t

0:00:32.410,0:00:36.570
fission on its own, weneed a little bit of
fissile material to start these up. Once started

0:00:36.570,0:00:40.770
though, we can run these on cheap and abundant
Thorium and keep their reactor going indefinitely

0:00:40.770,0:00:43.610
on this.
The great thing with Thorium and the U233

0:00:43.610,0:00:48.070
that chain, it can be done in any new type
of neutron spectrum, from the more common

0:00:48.070,0:00:54.070
thermal to the less used fast spectrum.
Processing of Thorium or processing in general

0:00:54.070,0:00:58.330
is extremely difficult for solid fuel reactors,
that'­s why there is a little bit of interest

0:00:58.330,0:01:02.780
world wide really not that much but since
we are dealing with fluids here it'­s much

0:01:02.780,0:01:07.560
simpler for fluid fuels like our Molten salts.
It'­s easier processing but it'­s still a

0:01:07.560,0:01:11.929
challenge and there is going to be a lot of
R&D money needed to bring that forward. Without

0:01:11.929,0:01:16.520
processing Thorium can be used with the aid
of Uranium, a little bit of low enriched Uranium,

0:01:16.520,0:01:21.490
can yield far superior, what we call converter
reactors or the simpler burner reactors, than

0:01:21.490,0:01:25.619
our current light water reactors or LWRs.
Now, a little bit of basics about Molten Salt

0:01:25.619,0:01:31.149
reactors. Molten Salt reactors is the more
broader term, lifter is a bit narrower and

0:01:31.149,0:01:35.770
a bit newer. But in general, our fuel which
is Thorium and/or Uranium and/or Plutonium

0:01:35.770,0:01:40.979
is dissolved in a carrier salt, Flibe is one
of the examples in enriched lithium and ?? Fluoride.

0:01:40.979,0:01:45.429
This fluid fuel is also the coolant and that
carries heat energy out of the core to heat

0:01:45.429,0:01:50.210
exchangers. It'­s very high temperature operation
typically around 700 degrees so that couples

0:01:50.210,0:01:53.810
very well to almost any kind of power system
you might imagine.

0:01:53.810,0:01:57.270
A lot of us are going to be talking about
brayton systems, supercritical carbon dioxide

0:01:57.270,0:02:02.249
and helium etc but it matches very well to
general ultra supercritical steam as well,

0:02:02.249,0:02:06.049
like the coal burners are using right now-
so we can use off the shelf technology as

0:02:06.049,0:02:09.890
well even things like open air cycles.
The text book design is called the Single

0:02:09.890,0:02:14.830
fluid Graphite Moderated Molten Salt Breeder
reactor, this is straight out of the Gen 4

0:02:14.830,0:02:18.280
program, generation 4 program that look at
advanced reactors for the future, this is

0:02:18.280,0:02:21.670
one of 6 of them.
In this design the core itself was just a

0:02:21.670,0:02:27.160
large tank filled with graphite logs basically,
that the fluid salt flows in and in the reactor

0:02:27.160,0:02:32.060
it'­s critical so heat is generated then that
same fluid salt flows out to the heat exchanger,

0:02:32.060,0:02:36.300
gives its heat to clean salt and then that
clean salt will either in this diagram to

0:02:36.300,0:02:41.220
a brayton cycle or, like I said, it could
be steam, it could be almost anything.

0:02:41.220,0:02:45.430
Near the bottom we have this freeze plug,
so basically anything goes wrong we lose power

0:02:45.430,0:02:50.000
etc that freeze plug will melt and the salts
are drained the tanks that are specifically

0:02:50.000,0:02:53.650
built to deal with that decay heat. There
is a lot of design choices, one is breeder

0:02:53.650,0:02:58.200
versus converter, breeder means it makes your
own fuel after you start it up.

0:02:58.200,0:03:02.170
And if we just make just enough to keep going
that'­s nice because we don'­t have to worry

0:03:02.170,0:03:06.210
about shipping out any fissile material etc,
we call that break even breeding and most

0:03:06.210,0:03:10.780
of us feel that that'­s the way we should
be going. That requires the processing of

0:03:10.780,0:03:15.140
the fission products to continuously, fairly
slowly but continuously remove them.

0:03:15.140,0:03:19.200
We might need some enrichment plans now to
get them going but once we'­re going on that

0:03:19.200,0:03:24.340
we don'­t need new enrichment plans anymore.
Converter reactors on the other hand we need

0:03:24.340,0:03:29.780
some annual fissile makeup which is typically
going to be low in enriched uranium, but that

0:03:29.780,0:03:34.900
skips fuel processing, or at least it skips
it for decades and we do it after the sort

0:03:34.900,0:03:41.860
of life time of the salt etc. Much less R&D
needed, much simpler designs, we'­re much

0:03:41.860,0:03:46.250
more ready to go with things and the core
design is typically much simplified.

0:03:46.250,0:03:50.100
There is also what we call the single fluid
or two fluid and they'­re even confused that

0:03:50.100,0:03:54.430
there is something called a one and a half
fluid. Single fluid everything is one carrier

0:03:54.430,0:04:00.050
salt as it'­s fairly obvious, the core design
is typically a fair bit simpler this way.

0:04:00.050,0:04:03.090
Processing in order to remove those fission
products is a lot harder it'­s not as hard

0:04:03.090,0:04:08.120
as solid fuels but it'­s the hardest way with
liquid fuels because Thorium itself is very

0:04:08.120,0:04:12.860
very chemically similar to the rarer fission
products that are the most important ones

0:04:12.860,0:04:15.260
to remove.
Two fluid designs on the other hand, they

0:04:15.260,0:04:19.569
have a separate salt for the thorium that
sort of catches neutrons and a fuel salt for

0:04:19.569,0:04:24.469
the uranium 233 that that blanket salt produces.
Fission product removal is a lot simpler because

0:04:24.469,0:04:27.889
the fission products are produced in the fuel
salt and there is no Thorium there so it'­s

0:04:27.889,0:04:31.960
a lot easier. Core design was thought to be
a lot more complex, what Oakridge looked at,

0:04:31.960,0:04:38.120
Oakridge developed these in the 50s, 60s and
70s. The design they looked at was very complicated

0:04:38.120,0:04:41.979
we think there'­s a lot easier ways to do
this now but pretty much any kind of two fluid

0:04:41.979,0:04:46.430
design we have to verify these barrier materials,
it could be even graphite itself, but there

0:04:46.430,0:04:49.159
are a lot of different choices to separate
those two salts.

0:04:49.159,0:04:53.139
It shouldn'­t be very hard but it'­s something
we need to do and anything nuclear can be

0:04:53.139,0:04:57.710
quite expensive. Then we have either harder
or softer spectrum between thermal and fast

0:04:57.710,0:05:01.460
spectrums. Harder spectrum are fast, we can
skip using graphite, graphite is not really

0:05:01.460,0:05:05.499
that hard to use with these reactors but if
we can rid of it it'­s probably a good idea

0:05:05.499,0:05:09.810
to, just one less thing to worry about.
Easier to breed, we get sort of more neutrons

0:05:09.810,0:05:14.009
per fission etc. Although it typically takes
a lot more fissile material to start it up

0:05:14.009,0:05:17.210
and there is some exceptions but that is a
general rule of thumb. And avoiding what I

0:05:17.210,0:05:22.650
call neutron leakage can be a problem, in
a harder spectrum design it can be, and especially

0:05:22.650,0:05:27.240
in the single fluid, harder to avoid losing
a lot of neutrons to leakage, we have this

0:05:27.240,0:05:29.580
sort of neutron budget that we have to worry
about.

0:05:29.580,0:05:34.349
With a softer spectrum control is a lot easier
as well, things happen a lot slower with thermal

0:05:34.349,0:05:39.129
neutrons. Much smaller fissile material to
start up but we need to remove those fission

0:05:39.129,0:05:41.719
products faster if we want to breed or break
even.

0:05:41.719,0:05:47.449
Now, my main design efforts have been in a
two fluid design, what'­s called a tube within

0:05:47.449,0:05:52.499
tube hopefully solves what Oakridge often
termed their plumbing problem which is the

0:05:52.499,0:05:56.870
complexity they had to deal with. It'­s a
very simple geometric sort of trick in a sense

0:05:56.870,0:06:02.509
to get good size power cords of this two fluid
design with much simpler plumbing so to speak.

0:06:02.509,0:06:07.210
I sort of consider high performance big as
bang for your buck? But there is significant

0:06:07.210,0:06:13.319
R&D needed for this design and in most designs.
My other main focus for the last couple of

0:06:13.319,0:06:17.680
years has been on what'­s called the denatured
molten salt reactor DMSR, this was developed

0:06:17.680,0:06:22.099
in the late 70s at Oakridge national apse?
It'­s a really simple design, it'­s basically

0:06:22.099,0:06:27.120
just a larger version of the test reactor
that they built on the 60s, a lot less R&D

0:06:27.120,0:06:31.379
needed and now, it doesn'­t break even so
it needs a little bit of manual fuel which

0:06:31.379,0:06:35.830
is low enriched uranium which is very much
available, so it uses a mix of low enriched

0:06:35.830,0:06:39.870
uranium and Thorium, most of the energy comes
from Thorium but it'­s sort of helped along

0:06:39.870,0:06:45.430
by that low enriched uranium.
Now since October 2010 to use a term Jim Kennedy

0:06:45.430,0:06:49.620
was using about the Chinese sometimes, I'­ve
sort of gone dark so I'­ve been working on

0:06:49.620,0:06:55.029
a lot of new areas but instead of going public
right away with a lot of my' so keeping things

0:06:55.029,0:07:00.789
a bit secret so sorry no hints but quite excited
and looking forward to sharing these with

0:07:00.789,0:07:03.319
you.
Now how do you judge a reactor in general

0:07:03.319,0:07:09.289
and that then guides us to what sort of design
criteria we should chose, of course safety,

0:07:09.289,0:07:14.939
costs, resource sustainability and long lived
waste I think these are really the most important

0:07:14.939,0:07:20.520
and pretty much every design we look at with
molten salt reactors these issues are very

0:07:20.520,0:07:22.199
similar.
What can be a little bit different between

0:07:22.199,0:07:26.409
designs is proliferation resistance, we have
a good story in all our different types of

0:07:26.409,0:07:31.069
designs and it'­s a bit of an apples and oranges
comparison it'­s hard to make a really detailed

0:07:31.069,0:07:36.539
comparison but I think some can be labelled
extremely high proliferation resistance.

0:07:36.539,0:07:40.669
Rapid deployment capability, if we want to
build these by the hundreds or thousands to

0:07:40.669,0:07:45.199
really make a difference can we? And there
can be some differences there and then technological

0:07:45.199,0:07:49.129
uncertainty, how much R&D we'­re going to
need to move forward. Now as I say advantages

0:07:49.129,0:07:53.349
of all molten salt reactors is the safety
we don'­t have large pressure vessels that

0:07:53.349,0:07:57.379
could possibly fail. There'­s no really no
chemical driving forces here.

0:07:57.379,0:08:01.889
We have no water so no steam, or explosions
or hydrogen production we have no zirconium

0:08:01.889,0:08:08.369
water interactions etc. The graphite can technically
burn but that'­s about all it can do and it'­s

0:08:08.369,0:08:12.680
very simple to avoid that of course some of
our designs don'­t even have graphite.

0:08:12.680,0:08:17.349
There'­s almost no volatile fission products
in the salt, all these accidents Chernobyl,

0:08:17.349,0:08:21.490
fukushima, it'­s the volatile things, things
that will go off into the air and spread out

0:08:21.490,0:08:26.839
that'­s the real issue. Its'­ almost impossible
to imagine how radiation can be spread from

0:08:26.839,0:08:31.499
a nuclear reactor beyond these things.
They get into bizarre corium hidden water

0:08:31.499,0:08:35.449
in a certain way water getting inside the
corium and then exploding, you really have

0:08:35.449,0:08:40.360
to be imagining beyond these volatile. But
with the molten salts those volatile elements

0:08:40.360,0:08:44.169
they come out naturally they come out while
we'­re running, we collect them, store them

0:08:44.169,0:08:48.750
completely separate from their reactor.
So if anything goes wrong, even a terrorist

0:08:48.750,0:08:53.470
attack, a missile strike etc you might splash
some salt around but it basically lands and

0:08:53.470,0:08:55.660
hardens and very very little will come out
of it.

0:08:55.660,0:09:01.050
But we don'­t need nay excess reactivity there'­s
no sort of shim rods or control rods that

0:09:01.050,0:09:04.050
could be accidently removed, we don'­t need
any of that.

0:09:04.050,0:09:08.320
They'­re very stable, the instantly acting
negative temperature reactivity coefficients

0:09:08.320,0:09:13.980
and again we have that freeze valve to lead
the core, lead the heat to where we can deal

0:09:13.980,0:09:17.190
with the decay heat best.
Low capital cost, molten salts in general

0:09:17.190,0:09:22.740
is not quite as well known they'­re just in
general excellent coolants, much better than

0:09:22.740,0:09:27.970
water, much much better than liquid sodium
etc. so your pumps are smaller the heat exchangers

0:09:27.970,0:09:31.000
are smaller and that makes things a lot easier
to fabricate.

0:09:31.000,0:09:36.639
This has a trickle down effect on your building
layout, construction schedules, factory fabrication

0:09:36.639,0:09:41.220
etc. of course we have a much higher thermal
efficiency, 44% we could probably push 50%

0:09:41.220,0:09:45.509
with these on our various choices and that'­s
another wonderful thing that we have so many

0:09:45.509,0:09:48.170
choices.
And of course the fuel cycle costs are very

0:09:48.170,0:09:54.420
very low and no need, since we have all this
sort of passive Safety things happen by physics

0:09:54.420,0:09:59.589
not by engineering design, we don'­t have
that defence in depth or these massive internal

0:09:59.589,0:10:04.550
structures to deal with steam containment
and vast water reserves to deal with that.

0:10:04.550,0:10:08.720
Just looking at the size of the heat exchangers
on the far left, we have the primary heat

0:10:08.720,0:10:14.389
exchanger, we need four of those for a 1000
megawatt plant and 16 of these tiny little

0:10:14.389,0:10:20.250
steam generator tubes versus in the middle
for those very large 70 foot tall steam generators

0:10:20.250,0:10:25.089
that the PWR folks need to work with.
And the sodium cool fast reactor people, they

0:10:25.089,0:10:30.060
love to show how tiny their reactor is itself
but they tend to neglect showing the absolutely

0:10:30.060,0:10:36.860
massive water to liquid sodium steam generators
and well their primary heat exchangers as

0:10:36.860,0:10:42.009
well so their volume is just enormous factor
compared to ours.

0:10:42.009,0:10:45.279
Resource sustainability, once we start these
breeder reactor designs, if we'­re running

0:10:45.279,0:10:50.550
them as breeders, all we need is just minor
amounts of thorium so 30000 dollars worth

0:10:50.550,0:10:55.069
of thorium well depends on your price per
kilowatt but half a billion dollars worth

0:10:55.069,0:10:58.550
of electricity.
Converter designs are a lot simpler and they

0:10:58.550,0:11:03.970
do require some uranium but very modest amounts.
Typically Oakridge'­s base design and we can

0:11:03.970,0:11:09.540
improve on that, is worth 35 tonnes of uranium
per GWe year a 1000 MWe plant running for

0:11:09.540,0:11:14.680
a year versus 200 tonnes of Light Water Reactors
and that gives a fuel cycle cost of under

0:11:14.680,0:11:19.149
a tenth of a cent per kilowatt hour so there'­s
not too much room for improvement there anyway.

0:11:19.149,0:11:22.440
And I would bring that up, uranium is not
really the enemy, thorium is an amazing on

0:11:22.440,0:11:26.589
its own but these reactors can help us use
uranium a lot better as well.

0:11:26.589,0:11:30.329
We'­re not going to run out of uranium in
20 years we can run out of cheap uranium and

0:11:30.329,0:11:34.529
that can start to hurt the light water folks,
because they need so much of it but if you

0:11:34.529,0:11:38.769
can find some competent geologists that know
their field they will tell you that there'­s

0:11:38.769,0:11:44.639
no way that the uranium could ever be really
more than 500$ a kg because then we'­d have

0:11:44.639,0:11:49.740
so much low grade? ores that'­d be economically
viable there. And even 500$ a kg in these

0:11:49.740,0:11:53.740
designs that use it'­s still only a couple
tenths of a cent per kilowatt-hour.

0:11:53.740,0:11:58.279
Now mining is maybe not pretty in general
but a 1.7 million tonnes of uranium ore that

0:11:58.279,0:12:03.440
was dug up in well 2009 had a world average
at 3% ore grade. We have to compare that,

0:12:03.440,0:12:10.440
mining is not pretty but there'­s 2500 million
tonnes of copper ore, 1700 Mt of iron ore

0:12:10.540,0:12:16.759
and 7000 Mt of coal so the mining picture
here is still a minor one.

0:12:16.759,0:12:21.009
And if uranium is used with thorium in the
dmsr designs we could have 100% of the worlds

0:12:21.009,0:12:25.860
electricity 25000 Giga watts without increasing
the mining we'­re doing already. And even

0:12:25.860,0:12:30.959
if we needed to go to very low-grade ores,
it might cost 500$ a kg but there'­s almost

0:12:30.959,0:12:36.230
unlimited supplies then it'­s still only a
couple hundred Mt of ore mine per year.

0:12:36.230,0:12:40.730
A long lived waste that'­s another great story
for molten salt reactors lifter in general,

0:12:40.730,0:12:44.430
the fission products were very similar to
almost any other reactor design but they'­re

0:12:44.430,0:12:49.410
almost all relatively benign after a few hundred
years. The real problem is what we call the

0:12:49.410,0:12:54.230
transuranics, things above uranium, neptunium,
specifically plutonium and even above that.

0:12:54.230,0:12:58.569
That'­s the real reason you have yucca mountains,
which are their repositories they'­re built

0:12:58.569,0:13:03.190
so that 100 years later we can sort of come
back and take that out because you also don'­t

0:13:03.190,0:13:08.300
want to bury plutonium for generations.
All the molten salt reactors designs, regardless

0:13:08.300,0:13:12.420
of the' they produce a lot less transuranics
and we can all just keep them in the salt

0:13:12.420,0:13:15.759
or every time we process make sure we put
them back in the salt. It'­s surprising to

0:13:15.759,0:13:19.639
many but I can show you the numbers if you
don'­t believe me, converters can do just

0:13:19.639,0:13:23.620
as well breeders than that.
Converters will produce a little more plutonium

0:13:23.620,0:13:28.529
a year but you only have to process it every
10, 20, 30 years so the picture can look just

0:13:28.529,0:13:34.350
as well. That blue line is the actinide waste,
that'­s the transuranics and that'­s what

0:13:34.350,0:13:39.110
is so nasty for so long and this is logarithmic
on both scales so going out into millions

0:13:39.110,0:13:41.990
of years.
That'­s what takes so long the dash line is

0:13:41.990,0:13:46.089
the fission products and they drop like a
rock through the first few hundred years and

0:13:46.089,0:13:51.569
then there'­s a few left that are just low
energy ?? etc nothing too much to be concerned

0:13:51.569,0:13:54.050
with.
The blue line shows for a fast breeder the

0:13:54.050,0:13:59.300
sodium guys and then this green line is for
the molten salt breeder reactor and that would

0:13:59.300,0:14:02.069
be very similar line for even the converter
reactors.

0:14:02.069,0:14:07.689
These arrows I have on the side, PWR U, DMSR
U and then the MSBR on Thorium, that shows

0:14:07.689,0:14:12.790
sort of when we run these reactors how much
radio toxicity we'­re actually destroying

0:14:12.790,0:14:18.730
in the world or transmuting and the DMSR design
we can do pretty much as well as the breeder

0:14:18.730,0:14:22.149
but we actually destroy a lot more natural
radio toxicity.

0:14:22.149,0:14:25.339
So it'­s probably the only reactor design
in the world that can make the claim that

0:14:25.339,0:14:29.689
when you run these reactors 300 years later
when the fission products have died away we'­ve

0:14:29.689,0:14:35.269
actually lowered the worlds radio toxicity
ok no other designs so we'­re doing the world

0:14:35.269,0:14:38.529
a favour doing that.
Now proliferation resistance is mainly a political

0:14:38.529,0:14:42.699
issue okay, if a country wants it they'­re
going to build simple graphite power reactors

0:14:42.699,0:14:47.360
etc. It'­s not really a technological issue
but that said we still should do whatever

0:14:47.360,0:14:51.089
we can to maximise proliferation resistance
of designs.

0:14:51.089,0:14:55.689
Now I will mention though that the media often
portrays thorium as somehow eliminating proliferation

0:14:55.689,0:14:59.720
concerns altogether, this is not true and
that'­s important to understand, it can really

0:14:59.720,0:15:05.420
help us but it'­s still something we have
to be vigilant about.

0:15:05.420,0:15:10.120
The proliferation resistance of the pure cycle,
what we'­d maybe call the breeder cycle, the

0:15:10.120,0:15:14.720
big benefit is from something called uranium
232, it'­s there a long time its got a 69

0:15:14.720,0:15:20.079
year life and one of its daughter products
makes a really high energy gamma ray, extremely

0:15:20.079,0:15:24.550
easy to detect if anyone was trying to smuggle
this around and makes it really hard to work

0:15:24.550,0:15:26.490
with.
And no national program has ever been based

0:15:26.490,0:15:33.269
on uranium 233. We can also easily denature
these by dumping in uranium 238 and that makes

0:15:33.269,0:15:38.009
the uranium useless for any kind of weapons.
The protractor ?? removal, I won'­t get into

0:15:38.009,0:15:42.759
details here, but that can be eliminated in
any design, even single fluids believe it

0:15:42.759,0:15:46.749
or not for those that know a little bit here
but that should be avoided because that can

0:15:46.749,0:15:51.600
lead to what you call clean 233 that doesn'­t
have that 232 contaminate.

0:15:51.600,0:15:55.730
And in these designs there'­s only tiny small
amounts of plutonium and its really really

0:15:55.730,0:16:00.529
poor quality, pretty much impossible even
to ever imagine. Denatured cycles though and

0:16:00.529,0:16:05.249
this includes the converted designs, with
the pure cycle it does represent highly enriched

0:16:05.249,0:16:09.699
uranium and those 3 words together will be
a non starter for a lot of people and it'­ll

0:16:09.699,0:16:13.290
be hard to even get them to look at things.
But if we run them denatured there'­s pros

0:16:13.290,0:16:18.620
and cons to that but that makes any uranium
completely useless for weapons. It does mean

0:16:18.620,0:16:22.310
we'­re going to have a it more plutonium and
again its surprising that there'­s not a big

0:16:22.310,0:16:26.730
difference in how much plutonium will be in
the salt but plutonium is a lot harder to

0:16:26.730,0:16:31.170
remove from the salts than uranium and it'­s
really poor quality plutonium.

0:16:31.170,0:16:35.589
It'­s debatable whether light water reactor
plutonium in the waste could ever be really

0:16:35.589,0:16:40.550
used to make a weapon, in the DMSR approach
is much poorer is the triple of the spontaneous

0:16:40.550,0:16:44.939
fission rate that makes things internally
and a lot more heat production.

0:16:44.939,0:16:49.810
The DMSR approach has been singled out in
various, well, in some studies

0:16:49.810,0:16:53.860
As probably being one of the highest proliferation
resistance of any possible reactor.

0:16:53.860,0:16:57.629
Rapid deployment capability is basically how
much fissile we need to start it there'­s

0:16:57.629,0:17:01.910
also the technological issues these are a
lot, any type design is a lot easier to built

0:17:01.910,0:17:05.880
than the light water reactors but one of the
differentiators is how much fissile to start

0:17:05.880,0:17:10.029
and what type. We don'­t really have many
U233 in the world but there'­s a little bit

0:17:10.029,0:17:12.390
here that we'­re trying to save in the United
states.

0:17:12.390,0:17:16.189
Spent fluid plutonium everyone talks about
that but its quite expensive to get at and

0:17:16.189,0:17:22.419
its also somewhat limited. Fast spectrum,
single fluid or one and a half fluid designs

0:17:22.419,0:17:26.419
they need a lot more fissile material to start
it up, up to 8 tonnes per Giga watt electrical.

0:17:26.419,0:17:32.000
Its still a little less form the fast breeder
guys but its still a lot in development. Two

0:17:32.000,0:17:36.900
fluid breeders or any denature design we can
start those with low enriched uranium, that'­s

0:17:36.900,0:17:41.159
another advantage of the two fluid design.
And another thing, can we make these small

0:17:41.159,0:17:45.230
to start? And there'­s differences there.
The two fluid designs with what I call a full

0:17:45.230,0:17:48.909
blanket around them, we can make them pretty
much as small as we want and please don'­t

0:17:48.909,0:17:52.419
start thinking were going to have them in
your basements or in your car, that'­s ridiculous

0:17:52.419,0:17:57.720
but we can make them quite small power.
Single fluid graphite converters, the sort

0:17:57.720,0:18:01.380
of neutron budget gets worse as you get smaller
but you'­re not trying to break even so yes

0:18:01.380,0:18:06.400
we can make those pretty small. The conventional
design the single fluid graphite breeder and

0:18:06.400,0:18:10.390
to break even that is actually very hard to
make them very small, of course 100-megawatt

0:18:10.390,0:18:15.830
size. And the single fluid fast breeder, the
French had the most well known design, that'­s

0:18:15.830,0:18:18.600
very hard as well.
Technological uncertainty that I think is

0:18:18.600,0:18:24.020
the biggest influentiator in these designs,
R&D and nuclear power is expensive so if we

0:18:24.020,0:18:27.529
can minimize this at least for the first generation
of designs we should do that.

0:18:27.529,0:18:32.429
The fission product removal, it does need
a lot of R&D even the two fluid design is

0:18:32.429,0:18:36.400
a lot simpler than that design but there'­s
still a lot of work that needs to be done

0:18:36.400,0:18:41.010
there before you have a commercial design.
And only single fluid graphite designs don'­t

0:18:41.010,0:18:46.429
really need the material that has to be verified
as some sort of barrier material that we have

0:18:46.429,0:18:53.429
to verify in a strong neutron fluid and going
beyond 700 degrees which some, well the French,

0:18:54.740,0:18:59.289
their design is pretty much forced to go in
that direction and then we'­re getting into

0:18:59.289,0:19:03.850
areas that we don'­t know the material science
that well, a lot to prove there.

0:19:03.850,0:19:09.140
If graphite is used some of us, there'­s different
designs that will or will not, we either have

0:19:09.140,0:19:14.270
large cores where we don'­t have to ever change
the graphite or we have to prove these replacement

0:19:14.270,0:19:16.820
technologies.
And summary then all Molten salt reactors

0:19:16.820,0:19:21.840
designs excel in safety, costs, resource usage,
long lived wastes. I think the tube in tube,

0:19:21.840,0:19:25.669
what I'­ve been promoting the two design may
offer the best overall capital cost and rapid

0:19:25.669,0:19:30.710
deployment and then the simpler design, the
DMSR design offers the very lowest in technological

0:19:30.710,0:19:33.580
uncertainty and really really high proliferation
resistance.

0:19:33.580,0:19:38.210
They all are high, I think this is the absolute
highest though. The inherent features, the

0:19:38.210,0:19:43.059
physics of them itself, they favour the overall
safe waste reduction, cost and deployment

0:19:43.059,0:19:47.090
but they also have a lot of flexibility, we
can attain the very highest levels of proliferation

0:19:47.090,0:19:52.200
resistance, we can run on minute amounts of
thorium or modest amount of uranium with thorium

0:19:52.200,0:19:56.260
for the utmost in simplicity.
There'­s a lot of things going around in the

0:19:56.260,0:20:02.770
backrooms that many are not aware of, it'­s
exciting times but sorry not quite ready for

0:20:02.770,0:20:09.770
public disclosure, but that'­s all I have
to say for now.
